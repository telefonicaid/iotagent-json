# IoT Agent JSON Roadmap

This product is a FIWARE Generic Enabler. If you would like to learn about the overall Roadmap of FIWARE, please check
"Roadmap" on the [FIWARE Catalogue](https://www.fiware.org/developers/catalogue/).

### Introduction

This IoT Agent uses the [FIWARE IoT Agent Node.js Library](https://github.com/telefonicaid/iotagent-node-lib) framework.
This is why most of the functionalities of this component depend on the new features of the library itself.

For this reason, the roadmap of this component would be defined by the IoT Agent Node Library Roadmap that you can check
[here](https://github.com/telefonicaid/iotagent-node-lib/blob/master/doc/roadmap.md)
