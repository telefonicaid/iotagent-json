An Internet of Things Agent for a JSON based protocol (with
[AMQP](https://www.amqp.org/), [HTTP](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/) and
[MQTT](https://mqtt.org/) transports). This IoT Agent is designed to be a bridge
between [JSON](https://json.org/) and the
[NGSI](https://swagger.lab.fiware.org/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fiware/specifications/master/OpenAPI/ngsiv2/ngsiv2-openapi.json)
interface of a context broker.

It is based on the
[IoT Agent Node.js Library](https://github.com/telefonicaid/iotagent-node-lib).
Further general information about the FIWARE IoT Agents framework, its
architecture and the common interaction model can be found in the library's
GitHub repository.

This project is part of [FIWARE](https://www.fiware.org/). For more information
check the FIWARE Catalogue entry for the
[IoT Agents](https://github.com/Fiware/catalogue/tree/master/iot-agents).

## How to use this image

The IoT Agent must be instantiated and connected to an instance of the [Orion Context Broker](https://fiware-orion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), a sample `docker-compose` file can be found below.

If the `IOTA_REGISTRY_TYPE=mongodb`, a [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) database 
instance is also required - the example below assumes that you
have a `/data` directory in your hosting system in order to hold database
files - please amend the attached volume to suit your own configuration.

```yml
version: '3.1'

volumes:
  mongodb:

services:
  iot-agent:
    image: fiware/iotagent-json
    hostname: iot-agent
    container_name: fiware-iot-agent
    depends_on:
        - mongodb
    expose:
        - "4041"
        - "7896"
    ports:
        - "4041:4041"
        - "7896:7896"
    environment:
        - "IOTA_CB_HOST=orion"
        - "IOTA_CB_PORT=1026"
        - "IOTA_NORTH_PORT=4041"
        - "IOTA_REGISTRY_TYPE=mongodb"
        - "IOTA_MONGO_HOST=mongo-db"
        - "IOTA_MONGO_PORT=27017"
        - "IOTA_MONGO_DB=iotagent-json"
        - "IOTA_HTTP_PORT=7896"
        - "IOTA_PROVIDER_URL=http://iot-agent:4041"

  mongodb:
    image: mongo:3.6
    hostname: mongo-db
    container_name: db-mongo
    ports:
        - "27017:27017"
    command: --bind_ip_all --smallfiles
    volumes:
        - mongodb:/data

  orion:
    image: fiware/orion
    hostname: orion
    container_name: fiware-orion
    depends_on:
        - mongodb
    expose:
        - "1026"
    ports:
        - "1026:1026"
    command: -dbhost mongodb
```

## Configuration with environment variables

Many settings can be configured using Docker environment variables. A typical IoT Agent
Docker container is driven by environment variables such as those shown below:

* `IOTA_CB_HOST`  - Hostname of the context broker to update context
* `IOTA_CB_PORT`  - Port that context broker listens on to update context
* `IOTA_NORTH_PORT` - Port used for configuring the IoT Agent and receiving context 
  updates from the context broker
* `IOTA_REGISTRY_TYPE` - Whether to hold IoT device info in memory or in a database
* `IOTA_MONGO_HOST` - The hostname of MongoDB - used for holding device and service
  information
* `IOTA_MONGO_PORT` - The port that MongoDB is listening on
* `IOTA_MONGO_DB` - The name of the database used in MongoDB
* `IOTA_HTTP_PORT` - The port where the IoT Agent listens for IoT device traffic over HTTP
* `IOTA_PROVIDER_URL` - URL passed to the Context Broker when commands are registered,
  used as a forwarding URL location when the Context Broker issues a command to a device

### Further Information

The full set of overrides for the general parameters applicable to all IoT Agents are 
described in the Configuration section of the IoT Agent Library
[Installation Guide](https://iotagent-node-lib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installationguide/index.html#configuration).

Further settings for IoT Agent for JSON itself - such as specific configurations
for MQTT, AMPQ and HTTP - can be found in the IoT Agent for JSON
[Installation Guide](https://fiware-iotagent-json.rtfd.io/en/latest/installationguide/index.html#configuration).

## How to build an image

The [Dockerfile](https://github.com/telefonicaid/iotagent-json/blob/master/docker/Dockerfile) associated with this image can be used to build an image in several ways:

* By default, the `Dockerfile` retrieves the **latest** version of the codebase direct from 
  GitHub (the `build-arg` is optional):

```console
docker build -t iot-agent . --build-arg DOWNLOAD=latest
```

* You can alter this to obtain the last **stable** release run this `Dockerfile` with the build
  argument `DOWNLOAD=stable`

```console
docker build -t iot-agent . --build-arg DOWNLOAD=stable
```

* You can also download a specific release by running this `Dockerfile` with the build argument
  `DOWNLOAD=<version>`

```console
docker build -t iot-agent . --build-arg DOWNLOAD=1.7.0
```

## Building from your own fork

To download code from your own fork of the GitHub repository add the `GITHUB_ACCOUNT`, `GITHUB_REPOSITORY` and `SOURCE_BRANCH` arguments (default `master`) to the `docker build` command.

```console
docker build -t iot-agent . \
    --build-arg GITHUB_ACCOUNT=<your account> \
    --build-arg GITHUB_REPOSITORY=<your repo> \
    --build-arg SOURCE_BRANCH=<your branch>
```

## Building from your own source files

Alternatively, if you want to build directly from your own sources, please copy the existing
`Dockerfile` into file the root of the repository and amend it to copy over your local source using :

```Dockerfile
COPY . /opt/iotajson/
```

Full instructions can be found within the `Dockerfile` itself.

### Docker Secrets

As an alternative to passing sensitive information via environment variables, `_FILE` may be appended to some sensitive environment variables, causing the initialization script to load the values for those variables from files present in the container. In particular, this can be used to load passwords from Docker secrets stored in `/run/secrets/<secret_name>` files.
For example:

```console
docker run --name iotagent -e IOTA_AUTH_PASSWORD_FILE=/run/secrets/password -d fiware/iotagent-json
```

Currently, this the `_FILE` suffix is supported for:

* `IOTA_AUTH_USER`
* `IOTA_AUTH_PASSWORD`
