# How this hook thing works? :) It a way of telling dockerhub autobuild how
# to build the container. It is explained at https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/builds/advanced,
# including the different env var (such as IMAGE_NAME, etc.) that can be used here. An
# easy to understand example can be found here: https://dev.to/samuelea/automate-your-builds-on-docker-hub-by-writing-a-build-hook-script-13fp
#
# Not every repository needs hooks, only the ones that needs special tunning. Standard
# dockerhub autobuild works well most of the times.
